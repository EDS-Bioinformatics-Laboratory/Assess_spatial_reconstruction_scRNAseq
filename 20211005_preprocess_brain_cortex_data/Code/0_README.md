### Directory content

This directory contains the script that is used to calculate the TPMs from the brain cortex fishseq counts. First it extracts the alliases of the gene symbols that were found in the cortex dataset. From the alliases and the original genenames we selected those names that were found in the ligand-receptor database that we used for CSOmap. The counts of the selected gene names will be normalized according to the TPM calculation of the package Scater. This script requires the following information. You require the original count table to which an additional column has to be added in which the original gene names are captilized (e.g dna->DNA). Additionally a file containing the Ligand Receptor interaction database also is required. We used the file supplied by Ren et al 2020. (https://github.com/zhongguojie1998/CSOmap/blob/master/CSOmap.matlab/data/demo/LR_pairs.mouse.txt)
The file that contains the brain cortex count data with added column of capitilized letters can be found on the google drive under the name cortrex_counts_with_capital_names.txt
We also added the resulting files, that is the orignal file (original_cortex_files.txt) used to calculate the distances in novoSpaRc. Furthermore, we included the original file with that only contained the counts of the ligand and receptor genes. Also, the file with the selected gene names for the affinity and reconstruction calculation (full_cortex_table.txt) was included.
