# Assessing spatial reconstruction using scRNA-seq data

**Date:** 5 October 2021

**Description:**
Code of the internship of Dean de Haas. Goal is to assess the assumptions made by CSOmap and novoSpaRc in order to reconstruct the cellular organization from scRNA-seq data

**Project participants:** Dean de Haas (student), Perry Moerland (supervisor)

This repository contains the code needed to preprocess the scRNA-seq data and the code used for calculating and plotting the correlation between the reconstructed tissue and the original tissue.
