### Directory content


This directory contains the R markdown script that was used to assess the reconstruction ability of CSOmap in order to reconstruct the tissue. In order to run this script you require to have the positions of the cells as calculated by CSOmap and the probabilities of the cells to be found in a layer. Furthermore, we assigned the cells the the layer in which it had the highest chance to be in a layer. The calculated positions and the real positions of the cells in the liver lobules tissue are found in the google drive as: 
calculated positions: CSOmap_calculated_positions_liver_lobules_tissue.txt
probabilities to the layers: liver_lobules_probabilities.txt
highest probabilities of the cells to layer: highest_probabilities_of_the_cells_to_layer.txt
