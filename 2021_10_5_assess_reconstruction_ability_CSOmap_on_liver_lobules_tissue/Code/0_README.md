### Directory content


This directory contains the R markdown script that was used to assess the reconstruction ability of CSOmap in order to reconstruct the tissue. In order to run this script you require to have the positions of the cells as calculated by CSOmap and the actual positions of the cells in the original tissue as comparison. The calculated positions and the real positions of the cells in the liver lobules tissue are found in the google drive as: 
calculated positions: CSOmap_calculated_positions_liver_lobules_tissue
true positions: liver_lobules_true_positions
