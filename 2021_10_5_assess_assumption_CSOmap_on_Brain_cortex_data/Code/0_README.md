### Directory content

This directory contains the R markdown script that was used to assess the assumption made by CSOmap in order to reconstruct the tissue. In order to run this script you require to have an affinity matrix as calculated by CSOmap and the actual positions of the cells in the original as comparison. The affinity matrix and the real positions of the cells in the brain cortex are found in the google drive as: affinity matrix: aff_matrix_brain_cortex true positions: brain_cortex_true_positions
