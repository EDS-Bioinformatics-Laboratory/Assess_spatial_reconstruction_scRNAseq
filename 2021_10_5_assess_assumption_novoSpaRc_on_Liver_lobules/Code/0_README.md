### Directory content

This directory contains the R markdown script that was used to assess the assumption made by novoSpaRc in order to reconstruct the tissue. In order to run this script you require to have a distance matrix as calculated by novoSpaRc and the actual positions of the cells in the original as comparison. The distance matrix and the real positions of the cells in the liver lobules are found in the google drive as: affinity matrix: distance_matrix_liver_lobules.csv true positions: liver_lobules_assigned_to_layers_per_cell.txt. Additionally the names of the cells were found in the cell_names.txt
